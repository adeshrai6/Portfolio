My name is Adesh Rai. I like creating things, and building apps is one of the best thing I like to do. I have been working with Object Oriented Programming(OOP) using Java to create some apps. I have worked on Java project called "House", where you could get data from a text file using Scanner and oupting data in the page for the user. App uaes given requirements from users, It outputs data like house address, minimum - maximum price, minimum - maximum beds, and minimum - maximum area.
